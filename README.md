## How to install & use :

You need to install NodeJS LTS Version : https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
To ensure everything is installed correctly, check if the following commands works in a terminal (or Powershell for windows):
```bash
node --version
```
```bash
npm -v
```

Once it's done, dezip the project, and open a terminal (powershell for windows) in the main folder of the projet, where package.json is located. Then type :

```bash
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies to run the server, then :
```bash
npm start
```
If all steps above were respected, you shouldn't have any errors. The process don't take more than a few seconds.
Now open a web browser and type : http://localhost:3000/ to enter in the local server you are running (3000 is the corresponding port).
Enjoy !
